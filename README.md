# DenyList

It is a Kotlin/Android app project in which you can add places you have visited, make comments about them, and reate them as you wish, so that you can always confirm if the place where you are going is not a place that you have been before and had a bad experience.

 In this project you will be able to:

1) Add places you have been, including name, comments and evaluation (rate);
2) Search places by name, and see their comments and rate (if it was added);
3) Delete the data of the place you want to, just search by name and delete it;
4) List all places you have added to your profile;
5) Edit name, comments or evaluation;
6) Delete all entries.

Improvements to be done:

1) Create a login interface using authentication; 
2) Make possible the searches be done not just using the exactly name stored into the database (case insensitive and onchange method to show tips while typing);
3) Create filters to show results by rates, specific words in comments, parts of the name (mentioned in the item 2), newest entries and oldest entries.


I am opened to listen to your opinions.

Thank you.
